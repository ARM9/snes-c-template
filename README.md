## C project template for wdc816cc ##

Using this for wip stuff at the moment, sorry for the mess!

Convention:
    TODO double check: Compiler sets accumulator to known width (16 bit) prior to function calls, it would be wise to reset it accordingly after you're done.
	Index registers stay 16-bit at all times, make sure to change back if you use 8-bit index registers.
